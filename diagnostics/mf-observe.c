/* Make Electra take its software path, by changing its mind rather than the

 *
 * Electra does not ask the MFT whether decoding is in software -- withholding
 * SET_D3D_MANAGER was therefore useless. It asks its OWN platform handle,
 * IsSoftware(), and because CrossOver's winegstreamer still advertises
 * MF_SA_D3D_AWARE it has already built itself a D3D11 device and answers no.
 * It then takes the branch that requires IMFDXGIBuffer on the output buffer,
 * which a system-memory buffer can never satisfy, and drops every frame
 * without ever reaching the IMF2DBuffer query we hooked.
 *
 * winevideo reaches the same end by patching winegstreamer to report no D3D
 * awareness on macOS (patch 0005, "UE ElectraPlayer takes its software decode
 * path on macOS"). From inside the process the equivalent is to answer the two
 * questions Electra actually asks:
 *
 *   1. the console variable that selects the upload-heap path -> 1, so the
 *      decoder stores the sample and queries nothing
 *   2. IsSoftware() -> true at both call sites, so the consumer takes the
 *      branch that accepts a plain buffer
 *
 * The second site is not optional. If the renderer reports D3D11 the outer
 * gate is false, DecodedHeight stays at the frame height instead of one and a
 * half times it, and the renderer is handed a luma-only frame.
 *
 * Offsets are from the disassembly of this exact executable, so every one is
 * verified against the bytes that should be there before anything is written.
 * A game update moves them, and then this must do nothing rather than corrupt
 * something. */
