**Backend and DX are not preferences, they are requirements.** Persona 5
Strikers only works on DXMT: it needs a shared D3D9 surface handle, and DXMT
implements sharing where D3DMetal has none to build on. The other five run on
D3DMetal with the D3D12 renderer, which is also what keeps PSO precompilation
-- `-dx11` dodges some of these faults and costs permanent shader-compilation
stutter.

**None of these games needs CrossOver patched.** That was not true when this
project started, and it is the single biggest thing that changed: CrossOver
Preview decodes VP9 profile 0 and 2, H.264 and AAC on its own. Persona 5
Strikers needs a VC-1 decoder CrossOver does not ship, and that is staged
beside it rather than patched into it.

None of these fixes decodes anything. The frames existed all along; they were
being crashed on, mislabelled, or thrown away.

Every row is a title we deliberately took on, and every claim on the linked
page comes from a measurement on an installed copy.
