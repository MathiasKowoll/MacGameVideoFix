NOTE = """
**Backend and DX are not preferences, they are requirements.** Persona 5
Strikers, Nioh and Nioh 2 only work on DXMT: all three need a shared D3D9
surface handle, and DXMT implements sharing where D3DMetal has none to build on.
Nioh 3, despite the name, belongs with the other group -- it is D3D12 on
D3DMetal and never touches D3D9, and NieR Replicant is D3D11 on D3DMetal. The
other eight run on
D3DMetal with the D3D12 renderer, which is also what keeps PSO precompilation
-- `-dx11` dodges some of these faults and costs permanent shader-compilation
stutter.

**Which CrossOver, and what "Preview" means.** Every measurement here was taken
against CrossOver 26.3 and `crossover-preview-arm64-20260821`, and the CrossOver
column says which of the two a title was measured on rather than which it might
work on. Everything runs on that Preview. Three are confirmed on 26.3 as well.
This project targets that Preview build, and it is what every title is measured
and supported on. Three also run on stable 26.3 and the column says so, but as a
bonus rather than a promise -- stable is not what gets tested before a release.

What stops the other three is in the engine. Both Life is Strange titles freeze
on 26.3 with the fix removed exactly as they do with it, so nothing installed
beside the game is involved; what differs is D3DMetal, 3.0 against 4.0b2. And
DYNASTY WARRIORS needs a WebM demuxer that 26.3 has no way to reach -- staging
the plugin was tried and the video still never starts. Persona 5 Strikers plays on both, which is what its
fix predicted: it stages its own decoder, so what CrossOver ships stops
mattering. A first attempt on 26.3 failed and was recorded as the title not
working there -- wrongly. The staged codec is built against one CrossOver and is
not usable under another, and none had been built for 26.3 yet.
DYNASTY WARRIORS crashes there too; that much was run, while the reason given for
it is read from the two installs' plugin sets rather than from watching it fail.

Four rows record an absence rather than a result: the three Nioh titles and
NieR Replicant were fixed on Preview and none was launched on 26.3, so nothing
is claimed either way.
Their codec is staged the same way Strikers' is, which is the half that made
Strikers portable, but the bridge half has only ever run against the Preview
build's DXMT.

**None of these games needs CrossOver patched, wherever the container can be
opened.** That was not true when this project started, and it is the single
biggest thing that changed. The qualifier is the whole of what remains, and it
is a container question rather than a codec one.

Both builds decode VP9 the same way; what only Preview can do is open a WebM,
which is the whole of the difference. DYNASTY WARRIORS ships 355 `.webm`
cutscenes and cannot get as far as decoding on stable, while Mortal Shell 2
ships the same codec in `.mp4`, which both builds handle. The plugin-by-plugin
comparison the conclusion rests on is in [Findings](Findings.md), under *The
container, not the codec*.

Three titles need a codec no CrossOver ships -- VC-1 for Persona 5 Strikers,
WMV3 for Nioh and Nioh 2 -- and it is staged beside the game rather than patched
into it. Nioh 3 needs none: its video is already NV12 by the time Media
Foundation is asked for it.

None of these fixes decodes anything. The frames existed all along; they were
being crashed on, mislabelled, or thrown away.

Every row is a title we deliberately took on, and every claim on the linked
page comes from a measurement on an installed copy.
